## Introduction to Iterators, Generators, and yield keyword in Python

There is a [countries.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cooleekova/Homework_Iterators/master/countries.json) file with a list of world countries.

The **Wiki.py** script looks up for a Wikipedia page for each country and writes a country-link pair to the json file.

The **generator.py** script (generator) takes a path to a file and on each iteration returns an md5 hash of each line of the file.
